# üèÄ NBA Data Analysis (2004‚Äì2024)

This project involves collecting, transforming, and visualizing seasonal NBA data for players and teams from **2004 to 2024**. The data is sourced from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and the key objectives are to:

- Build Tableau dashboards for player and team stats visualization  
- Predict NBA awards (MVP, DPOY, ROY, etc.) using ML models and visualize player comparisons for players considered for awards
- Analyze trends across 20+ years of NBA history
